## Demo app
The source code for the demo app is included in the package example
and is available [here](https://github.com/NikolayNIK/material_table_view_demo).

Demo app compiled as an Android app is available on [the Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nikolaynik.material_table_view_demo).

Demo app compiled as a web app is hosted [here](https://master--material-table-view-demo.nikolaynik.com/).

## Project goals
1. To provide intuitive, visually consistent and customizable UI/UX with opinionated defaults.
1. To make the solution adaptable to any screen size, any input method and any platform.
1. To keep public API as stable as possible.
1. To keep as many features optional as possible.
1. To leave state management completely up to the developer: although some state management solutions might work better than others, the project should never dictate the choice. 
1. To avoid dependencies as much as possible.
1. To keep performance in mind as much as possible

## Features

- Customizability and reactivity: all headers, footers, rows and cells are widgets,
  which makes it easier to handle state changes as well as to infinitely customize the content.
- Both horizontal and vertical scrolling allowing to display large
  amount of data to the user.
- Lazily built fixed-height rows allowing for billions of rows
  to be in one table. Practice commonly known as virtualization.
- Optional dynamic height for each row allowing for more use cases.
- `ExpandableTableRow` widget that animates row expansion and shrinking.
- Fixed-width columns that can be frozen (fixed) at the edge of a screen
  instead of getting scrolled off-screen.
  This helps the user not to lose a row-identifying information
  while scrolling horizontally. Columns will automatically
  be unfrozen in case of insufficient horizontal space based
  on a developer-defined freeze priorities enabling a responsive design
  when the table will adjust to any screen size be it mobile or desktop.
- `sticky` column property, which causes frozen columns
  to scroll off of the edge but come back upon scrolling
  in the other direction to conserve the horizontal space when it's limited.
- Support for a custom individual row widget wrapper allowing
  the developer to wrap each individual row in on InkWell
  while containing all cell widgets inside enabling for
  many material interactions within that row.
- Support for placeholder rows.
- Support for custom optionally animated shading of the placeholder
  rows allowing the shader to depend on a vertical scrolling offset
  and to start or stop animating whenever any or none of
  the placeholders are visible.
- Included shimmer shader that allows for animated linear gradient
  to be applied to placeholder rows.
- Scroll behaviour defined by an application theme used
  including scroll physics, overscroll effects, etc.
  It means that the platform-default scrolling behaviour
  will be used by default unless overridden.
- Customizable vertical and horizontal scrollbar.
- Customizable animated wiggly dividers separating frozen and scrolled columns.
- Horizontally scrollable header and footer support.
- `SliverTableView` - sliver variant of a table view which can be used
  in a `CustomScrollView` alongside other slivers (including other instances
  of the `SliverTableView`) to be scrolled vertically by a single view.
  It features sticky header and footer, and the same capabilities as a regular `TableView`.
- `TableColumnControlHandlesPopupRoute` - a route that displays a custom popup
  as well as column control handles over a `TableView` or a `SliverTableView`
  that allow user to resize and reorder the columns.
- Row reordering feature implemented with Flutter's reorderable list mechanisms.
- Full RTL layout support.

## Usage

```dart
TableView.builder(
  columns: [
    const TableColumn(
      width: 56.0,
      freezePriority: 100,
    ),
    for (var i = 1; i < 100; i++)
      const TableColumn(width: 64),
  ],
  rowCount: 1048576,
  rowHeight: 56.0, // optional, but highly recommended
  rowBuilder: (context, row, contentBuilder) {
    if (noDataYetFor(row)) {
      return null; // to use a placeholder
    }

    // When [freezePriority] or [placeholderShade] are used, some widgets may not be used here.
    // For more information see the paragraph below.
    // To set the background color the row can be wrapped in a [ColoredBox].
    return Material(
      type: MaterialType.transparency, // only this type may be used to wrap the entire row
      child: InkWell(
        onTap: () => print('Row $row clicked'),
        child: contentBuilder(
          context,
          (context, column) => Text('$column'), // build a cell widget, any widget can be used here
        ),
      ),
    );
  },
  // specify other parameters for other features
),
```

## Limitations

### Row wrapping widgets restriction

Whenever at least one column gets frozen or placeholder shading is being used,
the table starts using custom composition to paint itself for optimization purposes.
In this case, restrictions described below start to apply.

Some widgets can not be used to wrap row widget built in
a rowBuilder and placeholderBuilder functions.
Any widget that may need to utilize compositing will either cause
an exception or will not work as expected.
This includes widgets like `RepaintBoundary`, `Opacity`, `ShaderMask`,
clipping widgets and more.

`Material` widget may only be used with
a specified type of `MaterialType.transparency`, which is the only
type not requiring compositing.
To set the background color `ColoredBox` can be used instead.

`Column`, `Row` and `Flex` widgets will throw a runtime exception upon
painting when their children are overflowing their bounds,
because they'll try to clip their children in case of overflow.

For some of these, special alternatives
are provided by the package that will work for that purpose
(and that purpose only):

- `TableRowOpacity` - an alternative for `Opacity` widget;
- `TableRowFadeTransition` - an alternative for `FadeTransition` widget;
- `tableRowDefaultAnimatedSwitcherTransitionBuilder` function - an alternative
  for the `AnimatedSwitcher.defaultTransitionBuilder` function
  which can be used as a `transitionBuilder` for the `AnimatedSwitcher` in that context
  as a default one will not work.

If any alternative you need is not available,
feel free to use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/NikolayNIK/material_table_view/discussions)
to search for an existing idea or to create a new one.

Drawing on top of cells in the row widget might not work as expected.

These limitations do **not** apply to cell widgets built by a `cellBuilder` closure.

## Known issues

- After the first column gets frozen on the
  right side, all columns after it suddenly disappear
  when they should either stay or get animated away.
  This issue appears only when a large enough right
  scroll padding specified so users are not expected
  to come across it.
- Vertical scrollbar is affected by horizontal stretching
  when using a stretching overscroll effect for the
  horizontal scroll that is default on Android causing the
  scrollbar to stretch off the screen on overscroll.
- Enabling/disabling either horizontal or vertical scrollbar
  for currently active tables will lead to a state loss
  and to possible runtime errors.
